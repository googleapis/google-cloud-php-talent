     *     @type \Google\Protobuf\Timestamp $posting_publish_time

     *           The timestamp this job posting was most recently published. The default
     *           value is the time the request arrives at the server. Invalid timestamps are
     *           ignored.
     *     @type \Google\Protobuf\Timestamp $posting_expire_time
     *           Optional but strongly recommended for the best service
     *           experience.
     *           The expiration timestamp of the job. After this timestamp, the
     *           job is marked as expired, and it no longer appears in search results. The
     *           expired job can't be deleted or listed by the [DeleteJob][] and
     *           [ListJobs][] APIs, but it can be retrieved with the [GetJob][] API or
     *           updated with the [UpdateJob][] API. An expired job can be updated and
     *           opened again by using a future expiration timestamp. Updating an expired
     *           job fails if there is another existing open job with same
     *           [company][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Job.name][], [language_code][] and [requisition_id][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Job.requisition_id].
     *           The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the
     *           overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum of open jobs
     *           count over the past week, otherwise jobs with earlier expire time are
     *           cleaned first. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned
     *           out.
     *           Invalid timestamps are ignored, and treated as expire time not provided.
     *           Timestamp before the instant request is made is considered valid, the job
     *           will be treated as expired immediately.
     *           If this value isn't provided at the time of job creation or is invalid,
     *           the job posting expires after 30 days from the job's creation time. For
     *           example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an
     *           unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC.
     *           If this value isn't provided on job update, it depends on the field masks
     *           set by [UpdateJobRequest.update_mask][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.UpdateJobRequest.update_mask]. If the field masks include
     *           [expiry_time][], or the masks are empty meaning that every field is
     *           updated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job's last
     *           update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn't updated.
     *     @type \Google\Protobuf\Timestamp $posting_create_time

     * opened again by using a future expiration timestamp. Updating an expired
     * job fails if there is another existing open job with same
     * [company][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Job.name][], [language_code][] and [requisition_id][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.Job.requisition_id].
     * The expired jobs are retained in our system for 90 days. However, the
     * overall expired job count cannot exceed 3 times the maximum of open jobs
     * count over the past week, otherwise jobs with earlier expire time are
     * cleaned first. Expired jobs are no longer accessible after they are cleaned
     * out.
     * Invalid timestamps are ignored, and treated as expire time not provided.
     * Timestamp before the instant request is made is considered valid, the job
     * will be treated as expired immediately.
     * If this value isn't provided at the time of job creation or is invalid,
     * the job posting expires after 30 days from the job's creation time. For
     * example, if the job was created on 2017/01/01 13:00AM UTC with an
     * unspecified expiration date, the job expires after 2017/01/31 13:00AM UTC.
     * If this value isn't provided on job update, it depends on the field masks
     * set by [UpdateJobRequest.update_mask][google.cloud.talent.v4beta1.UpdateJobRequest.update_mask]. If the field masks include
     * [expiry_time][], or the masks are empty meaning that every field is
     * updated, the job posting expires after 30 days from the job's last
     * update time. Otherwise the expiration date isn't updated.
